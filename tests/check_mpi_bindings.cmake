# ============================================================================ #
# Lint: the Neko-TOP library must call MPI only through the mpi_f08 interfaces.
# ============================================================================ #
# `implicit none` does not forbid calling a procedure without an explicit
# interface. An MPI routine missing from the `use mpi_f08, only:` list of the
# file calling it is therefore still accepted, but the call links to the
# legacy F77 binding, e.g. `mpi_barrier_` instead of `mpi_barrier_f08_`. That
# binding expects integer handles and a mandatory `ierror` argument; a call
# without `ierror` makes it store through whatever address is left in the
# argument register, corrupting memory. A submodule does not take `implicit
# none` from its parent module, so there MPI_Wtime is even typed integer.
#
# This script lists the undefined symbols of the library with `nm` and fails,
# naming each object file, if any of them is an F77 MPI binding: a lower-case
# `mpi_..._` symbol other than the mpi_f08 bindings (`..._f08_`, `..._f08ts_`),
# the `mpi_fortran_..._` constants such as MPI_IN_PLACE, and the
# `mpi_sizeof_..._` procedures of MPI_Sizeof, which has no F77 binding.

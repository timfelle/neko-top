!> Strict assertion criterion for a finite-difference sensitivity sweep.
!!
!! The historical assertion the sensitivity harness makes -- that the signed
!! relative error at the *smallest* perturbation of the sweep is within the
!! tolerance -- is a false green whenever that error crosses zero inside the
!! sweep: a gradient with a genuine bias \f$C\f$ can be sampled arbitrarily
!! close to the crossing and pass. This module implements the strict rule that
!! replaces it, and is deliberately kept free of MPI and of I/O so that it can
!! be exercised on recorded sweeps outside a simulation.
!!
!! **Model.** Over a sweep of perturbation magnitudes \f$m_k\f$ the signed
!! relative error behaves as
!! \f[ e(m) = C + A m^p + B m^{p+1} + \mathrm{noise}/m, \f]
!! with \f$p = 1\f$ for a one-sided and \f$p = 2\f$ for a central difference.
!! The quantity under test is the bias \f$C\f$: the value the error converges
!! to once truncation has vanished but before round-off takes over.
!!
!! **Two certificates, both always computed; the sweep passes if either one
!! certifies \f$|C| \le \mathrm{tolerance}\f$.**
!!
!!  * `BOUNDED`: a window of at least `fd_plateau_points` consecutive points
!!    whose signed errors span no more than `plateau_fraction * tolerance`.
!!    Truncation is negligible across such a window, so the window *bounds*
!!    the bias: \f$|C| \le |\mathrm{mean}| + k\,\mathrm{spread}\f$ with
!!    \f$k = \f$ `fd_spread_multiplier`. This branch is load-bearing rather
!!    than a convenience -- measured on the four checked-in unit cases,
!!    `volume` and `volume_filtered` are exactly linear in the design
!!    variable, have no truncation branch at all and find no order run at any
!!    order tolerance up to 2.0, so without `BOUNDED` they are two false reds
!!    on must-pass cases.
!!  * `FIT`: the differences \f$d_k = e_k - e_{k+1}\f$ cancel \f$C\f$ exactly,
!!    so the ratio \f$d_k/d_{k+1}\f$ measures the truncation order without
!!    knowing \f$C\f$. Over the longest run of consecutive ratios that are
!!    single-signed and of the expected order, \f$C\f$ is recovered by
!!    Richardson extrapolation from the two smallest points of the run and
!!    cross-checked against a three-term least-squares fit.
!!
!! `BOUNDED` yields a *bound* on the bias and `FIT` an *estimate* of it, which
!! is why they are reported under different labels; where both exist the
!! estimate is the one quoted, because it is the more accurate of the two.
!! When neither certificate can be formed at all the verdict is
!! `INCONCLUSIVE`: a loud failure saying the *sweep* is inadequate, which is
!! explicitly not the same statement as the gradient being wrong.
!!
!! **The order is solved for, not read off a single sweep ratio.** The closed
!! form \f$\hat p = \log(d_k/d_{k+1})/\log r\f$ needs a geometric sweep, and
!! the sweep the unit drivers actually run,
!! `[5e-1, 1e-1, 5e-2, 1e-2, 5e-3, 1e-3, 5e-4, 1e-4]`, is not one: its
!! successive ratios alternate 5, 2, 5, 2. Applying the closed form there
!! returns a wrong order with no indication that anything is wrong. The
!! general relation
!! \f[ R(p) = \frac{m_0^p - m_1^p}{m_1^p - m_2^p} \f]
!! is strictly increasing in \f$p\f$, so it is inverted by bisection instead;
!! on a geometric sweep that reduces exactly, not approximately, to the
!! closed form.
!!
!! **No bracketing gate.** Whether the sweep brackets the round-off upturn is
!! reported and never gated on. Measured over the recorded sweeps, requiring
!! an upturn rejects the very sweep that exposed the false green this rule
!! exists to fix, and lifts the false-red rate from 0.012 to 0.73 with no
!! value of the bracketing factor recovering it. Sign crossings of \f$e\f$ are
!! likewise counted and reported but never used to exclude points.

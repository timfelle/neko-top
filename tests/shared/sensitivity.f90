!> Shared finite-difference sensitivity checker.
!!
!! This single module is compiled into both the unit driver
!! (`tests/unit/sensitivity/problem_tester.f90`) and the regression driver
!! (`tests/regression/sensitivity/problem_tester.f90`). It contains:
!!  * MPI-safe perturbation/reduction handling (`glsum`, `pe_rank` guards) so it
!!    is correct both single-rank (unit) and multi-rank (regression, `mpirun`).
!!  * A real tolerance assertion on the analytic-vs-finite-difference agreement,
!!    so both lanes actually gate on correctness rather than only logging a CSV.
!!
!! The assertion is deliberately made on the error at the *smallest*
!! perturbation. For a one-sided forward difference the error at large
!! perturbations is dominated by truncation (\f$O(\epsilon)\f$) and must not be
!! asserted against; only as the perturbation shrinks does the estimate approach
!! the analytic sensitivity, exposing any genuine bias (missing coupling term,
!! wrong sign, wrong weighting) as a non-vanishing floor. Linear functionals
!! (e.g. the volume constraint) hit that floor at round-off; PDE-coupled
!! objectives hit a discretisation/steady-state floor set by the case.
!!
!! That assertion is a false green whenever the signed error crosses zero
!! inside the sweep -- the point nearest the crossing can be arbitrarily
!! small while the bias is not. Setting `optimization.fd_test_strict` swaps it
!! for the criterion in `fd_criterion`, which separates the bias from
!! truncation before asserting on it, distinguishes an inadequate sweep from a
!! wrong gradient, and writes its verdict to `FD_verdict_<case>.csv`. It is
!! off by default, so no existing case changes verdict; see
!! `fd_read_strict_options`.
!!
!! `report_sweep` additionally *reports* the minimum \f$|error|\f$ over the
!! sweep, and whether that minimum is interior to the sweep (a genuine
!! finite-difference floor) or sits at one of its ends (only a bound on one).
!! That is diagnostic output only: nothing is asserted on it. Which point of a
!! sweep a gating assertion ought to use is a separate question, deliberately
!! left open here rather than answered in passing.
!!
!! Both the perturbation list and the choice of one-sided or central differences
!! are configurable per case -- see `fd_read_perturbations` and
!! `fd_read_central_difference` -- and default to the historical behaviour.
!!
!! The sweep can differentiate along either of two directions, selected by
!! `fd_read_mode`:
!!  * `dof` (the default, historical) perturbs one design degree of freedom and
!!    compares against the assembled derivative at that dof. Which dof that is
!!    is now always reported, because the caller's usual choice -- the
!!    largest-|sensitivity| dof -- *moves* whenever the sensitivity field
!!    moves, so two runs of the same case can otherwise silently differentiate
!!    with respect to two different design variables;
!!  * `directional` perturbs the *whole* design along the normalised
!!    sensitivity direction and compares against the projection of the
!!    gradient onto it. That validates the entire gradient field at once rather
!!    than one component of it, and raises the finite-difference signal by
!!    roughly \f$\|g\|/|g_i|\f$, which buys back round-off headroom.
!!
!! Both go through one perturbation code path (`fd_run_sweep` and
!! `evaluate_perturbed`, which take a direction vector); the single-dof probe
!! is the one-hot special case of it, so the two cannot drift apart.
!!
!! **Inner product.** The design-space inner product used for both the
!! normalisation and the projection is the Euclidean one on the *assembled
!! nodal design coefficients*. It is not additionally weighted by the mass
!! matrix \f$B\f$, because the \f$B\f$ weighting is already inside the
!! sensitivities the harness is handed: the drivers call
!! `design%convert_to_directional_derivative`, which post-multiplies the
!! adjoint's \f$L^2\f$ Riesz representative \f$g_{L^2}\f$ by \f$B\f$, so what
!! arrives here is \f$g = B g_{L^2}\f$, the vector of partial derivatives with
!! respect to the nodal coefficients. Those are the variables the
!! finite difference actually perturbs, so
!! \f$ \langle g, s\rangle_2 = s^\mathsf{T} B g_{L^2}
!!     = \int_\Omega g_{L^2}\, s \,\mathrm{d}\Omega \f$:
!! the Euclidean pairing on coefficients *is* the \f$B\f$-weighted \f$L^2\f$
!! pairing of the underlying functions, expressed in the right variables.
!! Applying \f$B\f$ a second time would count it twice and is exactly the
!! inconsistency that would silently invalidate the test.

  !! @param perturbations The sweep of perturbation magnitudes, in any order.

  !! `direction`, the Taylor test passes a whole normalised gradient field, and
  !! nothing downstream distinguishes them. Factored out of the sweep so that
  !! the central-difference variant can reuse it for both the \f$x + h s\f$ and

  !! The design field is stored per element, (lx, ly, lz, nelv), so a dof on an
  !! element interface has one copy per adjoining element, possibly on

  !! equal on every copy of a shared dof, on every rank holding one. Both
  !! callers guarantee that by gather-scattering it with GS_OP_ADD -- the same
